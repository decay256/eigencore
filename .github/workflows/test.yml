# GitHub Actions - Test Workflow
# =============================================================================
# This runs automatically on every push and pull request.
# It ensures the code works before merging.
#
# What it does:
# 1. Sets up Python
# 2. Installs dependencies
# 3. Runs linter (ruff)
# 4. Runs all tests
# 5. Reports coverage
